Tic-Tac-Toe Game
1. The task for this project is simple, create a working Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
2. There should be a two player mode, players take turns placing × or#symbols on a 3 × 3 grid. 
3. There should also be a single player mode, where the computer should control one of the players. 
4. You are free to design the graphics and implementation in any way you want. Even though we will mostly be looking at your working program, code clarity and readability are also important. 
5. The AI component does not need to be sophisticated. You will not be penalized if your AI player loses. The only requirement is that it makes valid moves. 
6. Your program should be able to detect when a player has won and display an appropriate message.
